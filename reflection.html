    <p>Responsive Web Design or RWD allows a website to optimize itself to fit the screen of a device that it is being viewed through.
        Be it a mobile device, a tab or a tv screen, this allows the viewing experience to appear seamless and fluid. The way in which they function is 
        accomplished by components known as "breakpoints". The layout of a website is recognized by the designs implemented both before a specific breakpoint and 
        after it. It also employs a variety of techniques such as the ones mentioned below;<br><br>
        
        <li>Fluid grid (page elements are sized by a percentage and not absolutes like pixels)</li>
        <li>Flexible images</li>
        <li>Allowing a page to use different CSS styles</li>
        <li>Responsive layouts to adjust to screen sizes the page is being viewed on</li><br><br>
        
        Responsive Web Design relates to web design in one major way; the growth of mobile users. Now more that ever people are accessing websites 
        through the dimensions of a phone which demands web pages to be dynamic in their ability to adapt to the form factors.
        Even more so phones come in many shapes and sizes therefore its paramount that a web site is versatile enough to cater to all its users equally.
        Adjusting screen resolution, Flexible images by the form of aligning an image according to a header and setting max widths to certain images so that they
        may not lose its quality in the process is pivotal for RWD. <br><br>
        
        From my research I learnt by my research when making web apps is that they sadly do not come up to speed with native apps unless the users have a primed cache.
        This is because a lot of the content would need to be downloaded onto the browser during the initial execution which would make the webb app seem more sluggish 
        in comparison. native apps on the other hand would be downloaded and would appear seamless at launch because they simply need to download related data which is less.
        Native apps would also benefit from the user interfaces already present on that particular device. Furthermore native mobile apps would be far more customizable 
        in contract with web apps which would appear to lack control over its elements in the interactions with users. Web apps would also have to take into account the new touch gestures
        which have become prevalent on the devices the web app is being opened on to provide a more enjoyable experience. This could lead to a heavy burden on the loading each adn every time. <br><br>
        
        My learning experience in this course has been an interresting as well as an entertaining one due to the fact of trial an error involved. It was interesting to experiement with the various
        CSS styles and finding the unique combinations can could be produced by integrating JS files to HTML files. Creativity is certainly not my strong suit so it was sometimes
        uncomfortable to be handed so many wonderful tools and have to little creativity to beautify my websites. </p>
